# Write a program to enter base and height of a triangle and find its area.

# Input base and height 
base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

# Calculate area
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Display the result
print("The area of the triangle is:", area)
